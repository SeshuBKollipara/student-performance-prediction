# Student Performance Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a student will pass based on their study hours, previous academic scores, and parental education level.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the input dataset.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for training and evaluation.
- `outputs/`: Stores model evaluation results.
- `notebooks/`: For experimentation and visual analysis.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## How to Run

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Run `python src/train_models.py` from the project root.
